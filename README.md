# R-package-learning
This repository contains some basic and advanced R packages tutorial summarized by meself.

Here is the list of the package:
  * `dplyr` -- ###  data manipulating package.  Its syntax is similar to SQL.  Used to extract, re-order, group and join easily by pipe operator.
             
  * `tidyr` -- data manipulating/clean package.
             
             Used to separate and unite columns 
             
             Used to transform data's format (similar to `reshape2` package)
   
  * `reshape2` -- data format transformation package.
                
                Use `melt` and `cast` function to transfer data between long-format and wide-format.
